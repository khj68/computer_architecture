  ##   ●Phase 1  
    ### ●Algorithm Selection  
      ##### ● We first chose brute-force search  
        ##### Execution time in console : 46.47 ms  
      ##### ● We add some codes and changed algorithm to backtracking  
        ##### ```c++ if(sum_distance > ans) break;```  
        ##### Execution time in console : 25.14 ms  
        ##### We reduced time almost twice
