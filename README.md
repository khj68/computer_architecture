# TSP on MIPS

# Phase 1
High level language program

## Abstract
In this phase, we solve the TSP given in the assignment manual with the DFS algorithm. The algorithm uses the distance table reference and the problem branches pruning to reduce the search time. The proposed algorithm is implemented in C.

## Output

# Phase 2
In this phase, we manually compile the C program made in phase1 into MIPS assembly. The report introduces the MIPS assembly code compiled and the estimated execution time in terms of instruction count.

# Phase 3
## Abstract
In this phase, we found some errors and modified the assembly code slightly. After that, we confirmed that the result is correctly displayed on the console through SPIM, and calculated instruction count in manually and calculated it in SPIM. Finally, we compared the two to confirm the error.

## Output
(in progress)
